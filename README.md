## Description

This is a simple project to visualize Spotify data. The data used is the [MGD: Music Genre Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/4778563) published by Oliveira et al.

## Technologies

This project uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/), a very powerful combo for building visually-rich and interactive data visualizations. It also leverages Russell Samora's lightweight Scrolly component to create the scroll-based interaction.
