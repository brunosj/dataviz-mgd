  <h1>What are people listening to<br /> (and who gets paid)?</h1>

      There will not come as surprise to anyone: streaming is now dominating the
      music industry. Numbers from the Recording Industry Association of America
      indicate that streaming services accounted for 84 percent of recorded
      music revenues in 2022. The biggest player, Spotify, has reportedly paid
      out a total of $40 billion to artists since its creation ($7 billion in
      2021).

      This sounds like good news, but while streaming has revolutionized music
      consumption, it has also led to a stark concentration of wealth among a
      select few artists. A small fraction of top performers captures the
      majority of streams and revenues, leaving the vast majority of artists
      —often referred to as the "long tail"— struggling to make a sustainable
      income. This disparity highlights the challenges faced by emerging and
      independent musicians, who find it increasingly difficult to gain
      visibility and financial support in a landscape dominated by a handful of
      superstars.
